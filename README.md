## What is it?
A first person game that uses raycasting to simulate a 3D environment (like Wolfenstein).

Inside the game you can move with WASD and look around with the mouse (only horizontally, just like Wolfenstein).

The goal of the project is to implement a correct worldview, there are no enemies, no levels, no pickups (unlike Wolfenstein).

## How to use this?
1 - Clone this repository

2 - Run make

3 - Run ./cub3d <path_to_map>

You can choose from several maps in the ./maps/good folder.
